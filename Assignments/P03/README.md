|   2   | output.txt      | Output file that contains values from list         |

### Instructions

Write a class that will generate graphviz "dot" syntax so you can visualize the output of your data structures. 
Graphviz is used for "graph visualization" and provides a simple way to visualize linked data structures.

## Requirements

Your Graphviz class should be able to:
- Add nodes
- Add edges between nodes

The styles you need to implement are:
- Colored nodes
- Colored edges
- Edge direction includes: None, One, Both
- Node shapes: should include "record" plus at least 3 more from here
- Edge shapes: choose at least 4 from here
