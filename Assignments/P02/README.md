## Program 2 - MyVector Class 2
#### Due: 02-16-2023 (Thursday @ 2:00 p.m.)

## Overview

Getting help from [Lecture 04](../../Lectures/04-Day_05-06/main.cpp)  create a linked list based `Vector` class that will include the functionality listed below. You will achieve this by writing additional methods to add values, remove values, and maintain sorted values if needed. This class also needs the ability to be initialized with different data sources (files, other vectors, and arrays).

I'll give some basic linked list code to help, 

## Requirements

Using code from your own first program OR my implementation here, create a more robust MyVector class that includes some added functionality with the overloading of some C++ operators. The operations performed by using a particular operator will be defined by us with a brief discussion on what we should do. We do not have to abide by convention, we can define each operator to do anything we want.

- Overload << (ostream) so that printing to std out is easy.
- Overload << (ofstream) so that printing to out-file is easy.
- Overload [] so that your MyVector can be treated as an array (optional)
- Overload + (addition)
- Overload - (subtraction) (optional)
- Overload * (multiplication) (optional)
- Overload / (division) (optional)
- Overload == (equality)
- Overload = (assignment)
