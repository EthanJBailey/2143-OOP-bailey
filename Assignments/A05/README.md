### Designing a D&D Game
### Description:

This assignmet covers the creation of a Unified Modeling Language(UML) diagram for a Dungeons and Dragons game.
The first step of the process was identifying all the main components of the game which became classes that would be refined.
Then, based on the usage, a set of attributes and methods were created for each classes.
Finally, the commonailities between classes were noted and classes with repeating elements were split up into its own class
and relationships were formed.
